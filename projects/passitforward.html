            <div class="section-header">Our solution</div>
            <div class="description">With Pass it Forward, our aim was to create a structured, community based platform for users to exchange secondhand items with their real-life neighbors, fostering positive in-person interactions by promoting both fun and safety.</div>

            <br>
            <div class="description">Through our user interviews, we determined that the two primary concerns of our potential userbase are safety and reliability, both of which could be addressed through the creation of an app that fills the market niche that we discovered.</div>

            <div class="description">Our app has several measures for ensuring safety and reliability, in place throughout all steps of the verification and exchange process. I focused on designing the app's chat feature, which includes a scheduling system that makes it easy for users to meet up for item exchange.</div>

            <div class="description">The item exchange process:
              <ol>
                <li>The donator accepts an item request from the receiver</li>
                <li>The app provides a list of convenient public locations for meetup</li>
                <li>The app provides a list of time blocks within the next week</li>
                <li>Once the users have both selected locations and times that work for them, the app decides on a location and time that works for both users</li>
                <li>The users meet up at the designated time and place and complete the exchange</li>
                <li>Afterwards, both the donator and receiver are prompted to leave a review for the exchange</li>

          <div class="description">We conducted three rounds of unmoderated user testing through UserTesting.com. After each round, we evaluated our findings and made changes, most of which were in the areas of clarity and ease of use. Here are some of the changes that I ended up making to the chat flow.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-section">

          <div class="description" style="align-self: center">Some users found it unclear whether location items were selectable, so I added outlines in order to make this more obvious.</div>

          <img src="pass_it_forward/test2.png">
          <div class="description" style="align-self: center">Users thought that scheduled pickup times were not obvious, so I added a clear label for this on the pickup confirmation screen.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-section">
          <img src="pass_it_forward/test3.png">
          <div class="description" style="align-self: center">Users were confused by the fact that they were prompted to leave a review before they were sure that the exchange was completed, so I added an “Exchange complete” announcement to the review page.</div>

          <div>
            <div class="section-header">Final Prototype</div>
            <br>
            <div class="description">Ultimately, this was an incredibly rewarding process of designing a wholly original app from start to finish. I learned a lot from my teammates, the users who tested our prototype, and the existing products that we took inspiration from.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="description">If we were to take this project even further in the future, our hope is to expand the features that we offer, adding things like the ability to post requests for items that you are searching for.</div>
