        <div class="description" style="text-align: center; width:90%">A usability study conducted on the mobile app for CapMetro, Austin's premier public transportation service</div>
        <img src="../capmetro.png">

        <div class="section">
          <div class="description">CapMetro provides public transportation services for Austin and the greater Central Texas area. My team conducted a usability study on the CapMetro mobile app in order to discover how they can better serve their users.</div>
          <div class="description" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; align-self: flex-start; color: #0967a2">What I did:</div>
          <div class="description">
            <li>Conducted a preliminary heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis</li>
            <li>Created a screener to find the optimal participants for this study</li>
            <li>Devised user testing tasks and conducted seven user tests</li>
            <li>Summarized findings and recommendations in a final report</li>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">Heuristic Evaluation</div>
          <img src="capmetro/he1.png">
          <div class="description">Our first step was to conduct a heuristic evaluation of the CapMetro app, identifying weaknesses and particular areas of concern using the Nielsen Norman list of usability heuristics. For this task, I primarily focused on evaluating the User Control and Freedom heuristic.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">Competitive Analysis</div>
          <img src="capmetro/ca1.png">
          <img src="capmetro/ca2.png">
          <div class="description">Next, we conducted a competitive analysis on three direct and three indirect competitors to the CapMetro app. In this stage, I worked with my team to select companies and criteria for analysis and then performed a deep dive on the DoorDash app. We then produced a series of potential recommendations for the CapMetro app based on findings from its competitors.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">Screener</div>
          <img src="capmetro/screener.png">
          <div class="description">After completing our preliminary findings, we went on to create a screener to find optimal participants for our study. The screener includes questions regarding general demographics, location, and lifestyle, with a focus on transportation use. When making the screener, we took care to not reveal the purpose of the study too early so as not to bias respondents.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">User Testing</div>
          <img src="capmetro/usertest.png">
          <div class="description">We were now finally able to move on to the user testing stage. We devised seven tasks for our users to complete, created a moderator script and user forms, and then completed six in-person user tests as well as a pilot. For the user tests, my teammates and I took turns in the roles of moderator, notetaker, and filmmaker.
            <br><br>
            For each test, we first had the user answer a few preliminary questions, and then jumped right into the tasks, guided by the moderator. We provided them with a Google form that had task instructions in written form as well as post-task questions for them to answer. After they completed all the tasks, we directed them to another form with post-test questions regarding their overall experience with the app.

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">Final Report</div>
          <img src="capmetro/affinity map.png">
          <img src="capmetro/final.png">
          <div class="description">Finally, we analyzed the results of our user testing and compiled all of our findings and recommendations into a final report. We used affinity mapping to find common themes throughout all of our user tests and discovered many potential improvements to be made to the CapMetro app.
            <br><br>
            For the final report, I conducted a deep dive analysis on the fourth task, which consisted of finding a bus route to a specific location. I also performed a quantitative analysis on the data as a whole, obtaining a system usability score of 44.8/100, which is subpar compared to the industry average of 68.

        <div class="section">
          <div class="section-header">Final Takeaways</div>
          <div class="description">This was the first usability study that I ever completed from start to finish, and I learned a lot about all of the considerations that must go into a report like this.</div>
          <div class="description" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; align-self: flex-start; color: #0967a2">What I learned:</div>
          <div class="description">
            <li>Assessing your market and competitors is essential in a usability study, as this is how you can be sure your product is able to match the competition.</li>
            <li>Expert evaluations and user testing go hand in hand, as the former allows for the focused tackling of problem areas and the latter allows you to see how real users experience these issues.</li>
            <li>Properly conducting user testing involves taking a backseat and letting the user guide you to where they want to go.</li>
            <li>User testing outcomes can be very difficult to assess and derive results from, but the final product is worth it in the end!</li>
