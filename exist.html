            Above all, existentialism is a philosophy of being human. Although S&#248;ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were among its earliest 
            pioneers in the 1800s, the movement truly found its footing amidst the Second World War in the middle of the 20th century. This time 
            period was marked by great struggle and turmoil, to the point where traditional theories of life and morality no longer seemed to apply. 
            There are two major ways that existentialism differs from its philosophical predecessors. The first is its small scale, human-centered 
            approach: whereas previous philosophies took on the great task of discerning the true nature of the universe, the existentialists were more concerned with 
            illuminating what we as individuals can do with our place in it. The second is its emphasis on the lack of universal values: the starting 
            point of existentialism is nihilism, or the idea that life has no inherent meaning. But rather than viewing this as a bad thing, the 
            existentialists instead saw it as the opportunity for us to create our own values and meaning from the blank canvas that we're given.
            <br><br>
            Because there is no fixed meaning of life in existentialism, that means that there are no unequivocally good or bad endings either. You 
            simply make the choices that you want to make, and then decide how you feel about where you end up. Each of the existentialist philosophers 
            had their own specific ideas about how to make the most of the time that we have on earth. For the most part, however, they tended to agree 
            that it is most undesirable to live inauthentically and waste what freedom of choice you're given in your life. Essentially, being true to 
            yourself and present in your day to day life are the most important tenets of an existentialist lifestyle; everything else just follows after.

                        Kierkegaard is regarded by many to be the “father of existentialism”. As a philosopher and theologian, Kierkegaard was primarily concerned with the 
                        nature of our relationship to God. According to him, previous philosophers like Hegel were incorrect in deducing that it was possible for us to know 
                        the true nature of God and the universe; to have true faith is realize God's transcendence and believe in Him even when no rational proof can exist. 
                        Other than this, he also detailed two opposing lifestyles: the “aesthetic,” in which one makes no serious commitments and therefore has no true sense 
                        of self, and the “ethical,” in which one makes the choice to commit themself to universal principles. While the ethical lifestyle is desirable in 
                        comparison with the aesthetic, however, Kierkegaard is clear that the religious mode of existence is still what we should all strive for in the end.

                        Nietzsche is perhaps most well known for his famous quotation: “God is dead.” Much like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche was critical of traditional religious and 
                        moral values of his time, but rather than advocating for a closer personal relationship with God, Nietzsche called for a rejection of religion 
                        altogether. He believed that the concept of God no longer existed as an anchor for people to rely on as it once did, leaving them anxious and listless. In order for 
                        society to progress past this nihilistic state, we would have to come up with a new set of moral values altogether. Nietzsche saw everyone in society as 
                        exhibiting either “master” or “slave” morality: the former saw themselves as good simply because of the social position they occupied, while the latter 
                        consisted of those who viewed the master class as fundamentally evil and considered themselves moral in comparison. However, Nietzsche's belief was that 
                        we had to move past these traditional conceptions of “good” and “evil.” According to him, the ultimate ideal to strive for was that of the &#220;bermensch: 
                        an overhuman who was capable of establishing and imposing his own set of values, truly rising above traditional Christian morality once and for all.

                        Heidegger was one of several 20th century thinkers who popularized the study of phenomenology, an approach to philosophical thinking that centered 
                        human consciousness and the subjectivity in the ways that we perceive the world. Central to Heidegger's philosophy was the concept of “Dasein” (literally 
                        translated as “being there”), which he used to refer to our unique experience of existing in the world as humans. According to Heidegger, in order to live 
                        authentically, we would have to resist our natural tendency to become absorbed in the collective consciousness of “the They.”  The They in Heidegger's terms 
                        is a faceless concept of a group of people, referring to no one in particular but rather a set of values adopted by society at large. Heidegger believed that 
                        it was our responsibility to find authentic ways of relating to others rather than giving in to the superficial tendencies of the They. Worth noting is that 
                        Heidegger eventually became a member of the Nazi party of Germany, calling into question the potential connection between his philosophical and political views.

                        Sartre's main axiom is that “existence precedes essence”: we're born without any sort of preexisting nature or purpose, and it is the experiences we 
                        have throughout our life that shape who we become. According to Sartre, we're made up of two components: transcendence, or free will, and facticity, 
                        or the limitations imposed on us by our physical situation. In order to live authentically, we must maintain awareness of both sides of our condition. 
                        Denying the reality of either our freedom of choice or our physical limitations results in what Sartre refers to as bad faith. For many people, this 
                        comes in the form of retreating into contrived social roles without reflecting on their true inner self or desires. Sartre believed that conflict is 
                        inherent to the human condition, whether from anxiety due to a lack of control over our future selves, or realizing that we're all free 
                        beings whose desires may end up standing in opposition to one another. Regardless, Sartre's philosophy contains a hopeful message: despite the struggles 
                        that we will all encounter in life, we have the power to confront these situations in any way that we may choose.

                        Camus is perhaps most closely associated with the concept of absurdism. According to him, the universe is simply absurd: there is not much about the world 
                        that makes rational sense, and it would be a futile effort to attempt to ascribe meaning where there is none. Camus' absurdist philosophy may be best 
                        understood through his 1942 essay <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>. In the titular myth, Sisyphus is condemned to live out his days rolling a boulder up a hill. 
                        However, rather than despairing, Camus proposes that Sisyphus instead engages in the rebellious act of acknowledging the meaninglessness of his situation 
                        yet finding personal fulfillment in it regardless. If we each find some sort of project or purpose to dedicate ourselves to throughout our life just as Sisyphus did with his boulder, then we 
                        will be able to overcome the lack of meaning that's inherent in the universe and find for ourselves a reason for living. To Camus, life is akin to 
                        a sort of sporting match that happens to result in death: all that we can do is play as well as we possibly can until we reach the end.

                        Simone de Beauvoir was a feminist and existentialist thinker who maintained a close personal and professional relationship with Sartre throughout her lifetime. 
                        Within the existentialist realm, she was perhaps most known for her 1947 essay <i>The Ethics of Ambiguity</i>, in which she detailed a system of moral values 
                        that could be derived from Sartre's existentialist views. Like Sartre, Beauvoir believed that many lived their lives in bad faith, often clinging to false ideals 
                        of preordained values where none existed. According to Beauvoir, in order to live authentically, we must acknowledge the ambiguity that is 
                        inherent to the human condition, in that we exist as both subject for ourselves and object for others to interact with. This means that the best way for us 
                        to live is to recognize the freedom of ourselves as well as others, and dedicate our lives to being thoughtful and generous towards other people, putting work into 
                        social causes so that everyone may gain the equal opportunity to exercise their own free will.
