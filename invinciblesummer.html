        <h1>You died!</h1>
        <p>Seems like you didn't do anything particularly remarkable with your life. But who's to say 
            that that's a bad thing? You formed authentic connections with others, discovered an enjoyable 
            pastime to occupy yourself with, and lived through your days with quiet contentment. You weren't 
            provided with any clear routes to take, yet you managed to live in a way that was personally 
            fulfilling and true to yourself, and in this deadly sporting game of life, that's all that any 
            of us can really hope for.
