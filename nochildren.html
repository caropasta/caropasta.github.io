        <h1>You died!</h1>
        <p>Well, you managed to live a long, full life, which is more than a lot of people can say. But how 
            authentic to yourself were you? Sure, you had goals and made moves to achieve them, but it's obvious 
            that the family life just didn't fit into that, yet you refused to ever let go of this ideal that you 
            were clinging to. You were simply playing the role of the loving spouse and parent, but your heart was 
            always elsewhere. Wouldn't it have been better to commit yourself fully to what you knew it was that 
            you really wanted?
